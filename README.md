# beta_testing_application

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

- This is a simple project with a text and a button
- When the button is pressed, the text color changes between black and red
- The main goal is to apply beta testing using "App Distribution"
- After creating the flutter project, it was connected to a firebase project
- Then, app distribution was enabled in the firebase project
- Testers emails were added to send them an apk of the app
- An apk was uploaded to the firebase project
- The apk was sent to testers through mails to test the app
- Now, through app distribution, you can view who was invited as a tester, who accepted the invitation, who downloaded the app and testers feedbacks
